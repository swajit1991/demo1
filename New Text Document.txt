Downloading Files
WebDriver has no capability to access the Download dialog boxes presented by browsers when you click on a download link or button. However, we can bypass these dialog boxes using a separate program called "wget".

What is Wget?
Wget is a small and easy-to-use command-line program used to automate downloads. Basically, we will access Wget from our WebDriver script to perform the download process.

Setting up Wget
Step 1: In your C Drive, create a new folder and name it as "Wget".
